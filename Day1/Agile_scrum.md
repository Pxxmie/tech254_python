# Agile

What is Agile? 

Is a methodology focusing on framework of software development process. Focuses on incremental and small releases of software alone with customer feedback. 

-Iterative development 

-Collaboration between self organising and cross-functional teams 

### Agile vs Scrum

Agile is an approach to project management that emphasise completing projects in small increments. whereas Scrum is a type of Agile methodology which uses daily sprints in small deliverable process. 

### Agile frameworks

1) Scrum - emphasises small, cross-functional teams working in fixed lengths (usually 2-4 weeks) 

2) Kanban-Kanban is a visual framework that emphasises visualising work, limiting work in progress and maximising flow. 

3) Extreme programming (XP)- XP is an agile framework that emphasises close customer collaboration, continuous delivery, and high quality code. 

### Origins of Agile

Software developers in the 80s and 90s experienced high level of failed projects and noticed some common traits;

- Too much analysis upfront - over planning
- Restrictive to change control-due to not being able to change - products were not fit to purpose
- Too much uncertainty - difficult to plan, never finishing in the timescale.

Software developers collaborated and experimented with new ways of working. 

They took the successful ideas and wrote down a set of underlying values and principles; 

### The agile manifesto for software development -

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools - need to value collaboration and communication more than using tools and focusing on new technologies.
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation- the primary focus should be on delivery functional and usable software rather than spending large amount of time and effort on documentation 
- Responding to change- it's easier to modify and extend working software, than it is to update extensive documentation.
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation - reflects the agile principle of valuing individuals and interaction over processes and tools. - Building trust and transparency.
- **Responding to change over following a plan -** continuous improvement- by responding to change, teams have the opportunity to learn from their experiences and make improvements in real time.

What are things people have issues with in Agile

- if it is not managed properly the scope can appear massive.

### The 4 Agile values

- Individuals and Interaction
- Working Software
- Customer collaboration
- Responding to change

### The Agile Principles

1) Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through the early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

2) Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.

3) Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.

4) Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

5) Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6) The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.

7) Working software is the primary measure of progress.

8) Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9) Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

10) Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.

11) The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

12) At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly.

### Scrum Framework

Scrum is a team based framework to develop complex systems and products. 

- **Product Backlog -** product owner -signing off estimation - refers to a prioritized list of functionality which a product should contain.
- **Sprint Planning** - working as a team and breaking down tasks
- **Sprint backlog** - focusing on the highest priority items and ensuring they have a clear plan for achieving sprint goals.
- **Daily Scrum** - Daily stand up is an event that happens between 3-9 people - what did I accomplish yesterday? What will I work on today? Anything blocking my progress? Focus on the sprint goal.
- **Increment** - Tracking and reviewing- Stakeholder providing feedback and make any adjustment and continuous improvement.
- **Sprint Review** - customer/stakeholder getting involved- ensuring the product is meeting customer needs and making adjustment.
- **Sprint Retrospective -** Focuses on the team process, teamwork and continuous improvement. Team reflects on their practices and behaviours.

### The Three Pillars of Scrum

- **Transparency** 
Everyone presents the facts as they are collectively collaborators for the common organisation objective. No one has a hidden agenda.
- **Inspection** 
Not done by an inspector but by everyone on the scrum team. The inspection can be done for the product processes, people, aspects, practices.
- **Adaptation** 
Enables team to respond effectively to challenges and opportunities.

### Scrum Roles

- **Product Owner**
Key stakeholder who should have a deep understanding of the product and communicate with both the team and other stakeholders. Overall responsible for the product backlog.
- **Scrum Master** 
Ensures the team keeps to the values of Scrum, facilitates meetings and removes impediments. Such as authority over process. Help team achieve their goals and promoting scrum principles and practices.
- **Development Team** 
Effectively 3-9 people. (Over 9 people-makes 2 scrum teams) 
Decides how the work will be done.

### Scrum Team

- Co-located- same floor, same teams meeting etc
- Engaged with the customer(s) - Stakeholders
- Self- organising
- Accountable and empowered
- Cross-Functional

### Requirement Gathering

Groups of tasks and specification. 

### How can we effectively gather requirements

- Talk to stakeholders (communication)
- Verbal communication
- Documentation
- Talking to business analyst
- Interviews and surveys
- Seek feedback and ask questions - clarification

### User Stories

User stories do not include all the detail-they are only a pointer to the real requirement from the perspective of the end user. 

**************************************************“As a (type of user), I want (an action) so that (benefit/values)”************************************************** 

**Type of user**-This part identifies the type of user or role that is expressing a need or desire for the particular functionality. 

**Action (I want)** - This specifies the action or functionality that the user is seeking. It's the specific feature or capability they require. 

**Benefit (So that)** - This articulates the benefit or value that the user expects to gain from having the specified functionality. 

- **Business** - What problems are we trying to solve?
- **Development** - How might we build a solution to solve that problem?
- **Testing-** What about this, what could possibly happen?

### Writing a good user stories?

- **Understandable (by normal people)**
- **Follow As a … I want.. So that…**
- `I**ndependent**`
- **`Negotiable`                    = INVEST**
- **`Valuable`**
- **`Estimable`**
- **`Small`**
- **`Testable`**

**-User comes first** 

**-Use personas (role playing)** 

**-Create collaboratively** 

**-Keep your stories simple** 

**-Start with Epics** 

**-Refine stories until they are ready.** 

**-Add acceptance criteria** 

**-User paper cards**

**-Make them visible.**

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are the customized requirements for each user story, ensuring we're meeting the needs of our users.

### Definition of Done

is when all conditions, or acceptance criteria that a software product must satisfy are met and ready to be accepted by a user, customer, team, or consuming system.
